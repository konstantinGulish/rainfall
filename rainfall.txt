ROGRAM4:

ALGORITHM:
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons.

INPUTS
roofWidth, roofLength
PROCESSING STEPS
Convert width to inches
Convert length to inches
Multiply roofWidthInInches by roofLengthInInches and by rainFall
Divide the result by 231
OUTPUTS
display the runoffInGallons to the screen
_______________

PSEUDOCODE:

Prompt user for roofWidth
Get roofWidth
Prompt user for roofLength
Get roofLength
Prompt user for rainFall
Get rainFall
Calculate roofWidthInInches = roofWidth * 12
Calculate roofLengthInInches = roofLength * 12
Calculate runoffInCubicInches = roofWidthInInches * roofLengthInInches * rainFall
Calculate runoffInGallons = runoffInCubicInches / 231
Display runoffInGallons"# rainfall"
